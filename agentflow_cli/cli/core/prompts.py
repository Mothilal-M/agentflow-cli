"""Guided prompts for the Agentflow CLI.

Every interactive question in the CLI goes through this service rather than
calling Questionary directly, so that prompts share one theme, one cancellation
contract, and one non-interactive policy. Commands describe *what* they need to
ask; how it is rendered, and what happens when there is nobody to answer, is
decided here.

Cancellation is a normal outcome, not an error: each method returns ``None`` when
the user presses Ctrl+C or Esc, and callers are expected to treat that as "the
user changed their mind" and exit cleanly.
